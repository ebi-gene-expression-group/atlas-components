We reconstructed lineage [ionships during organoid differentiation through pseudotemporal ordering, and identified transcription factor networks associated with fate decisions. When comparing to adult human kidney, we reveal immaturity of all kidney organoid cell types. These results define impressive kidney organoid cell diversity, identify incomplete differentiation as a major roadblock for current directed differentiation protocols and provide a human adult kidney snRNA-seq dataset against which to benchmark future progress.

But the extent of heterogeneity within the colonic mesenchyme in these processes remains unknown. Using unbiased single-cell profiling of over 16,500 colonic mesenchymal cells, we reveal four subsets of fibroblasts expressing divergent transcriptional regulators and functional pathways, in addition to pericytes and myofibroblasts. We identified a niche population located in proximity to epithelial crypts expressing SOX6, F3 (CD142), and WNT genes essential for colonic epithelial stem cell function. In colitis, we observed dysregulation of this niche and emergence of an activated mesenchymal population. This subset expressed TNF superfamily member 14 (TNFSF14), fibroblastic reticular cell-associated genes, IL-33, and Lysyl oxidases. Further, it induced factors that impaired epithelial proliferation and maturation and contributed to oxidative stress and disease severity in vivo. Our work defines how the colonic mesenchyme remodels to fuel inflammation and barrier dysfunction in IBD.",

Here we analyzed by single-cell RNA sequencing combined with RNA in situ hybridization and lineage tracing of WT1+ cells the cellular composition, location, and hierarchy of epicardial stromal cells (EpiSC) in comparison to activated myocardial fibroblasts/stromal cells in infarcted mouse hearts. We identified 11 transcriptionally distinct EpiSC populations, that can be classified in three groups each containing a cluster of proliferating cells. Two groups expressed cardiac specification makers and sarcomeric proteins suggestive of cardiomyogenic potential. Transcripts of HIF-1α and HIF-responsive genes were enriched in EpiSC consistent with the epicardium being a hypoxic niche. Expression of paracrine factors was not limited to WT1+ cells but was a general feature of activated cardiac stromal cells. Our findings provide the cellular framework by which myocardial ischemia may trigger in EpiSC the formation of cardioprotective/regenerative responses.",

Here we analyze bulk and single cell RNA-Seq datasets to identify cell types in the olfactory epithelium and olfactory bulb that express cell entry molecules that mediate infection by SARS-CoV-2 (CoV-2), the causal agent in COVID-19. We find that samples from whole olfactory mucosa in species including mouse and human express two key genes involved in CoV-2 entry, ACE2 and TMPRSS2. However, neither olfactory sensory neurons nor olfactory bulb neurons express these genes, which are instead expressed in support cells, stem cells, and perivascular cells. These findings suggest that CoV-2 infection of non-neuronal cell types leads to anosmia and related disturbances in odor perception in COVID-19 patients. Two 15 min Drop-seq runs from a single dissociation of the olfactory bulbs were obtained from 2 mice. Two such dissociations were performed, giving 4 total replicates. Additional Drop-Seq data from the olfactory mucosa can be found in GSE151346.",

      "longDescription": "The purpose of this study was to define, at the single cell level, the transcriptional profile of murine tail epidermal basal cells during postnatal growth and to compare with adult homeostatic basal cells. The analysis was performed on Lgr5DTR-EGFP mice (Tian et al., 2011)(knockin mice containing an Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (EGFP) under the control of the Lgr5 regulatory region), allowing to identify and exclude Lgr5-expressing cells of the bulge and basal cells of the interfollicular epidermis were enriched using EGFP negative, CD34 negative, alpha6 integrin positive gating. Our single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that epidermal basal cells at P7 form a more uniform population compared to adult basal cells and that heterogeneity starts to appear around P30. Mouse tail epidermis was collected on mice at postnatal day 7, 30 and 60. (3 samples) The libraries were prepared using the Chromium Single Cell 3’ Library Kit (V2-chemistry, PN-120233, 10X Genomics), quantified using a low coverage Illumina NextSeq 550 run and sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq generating 343M, 245M and 336M reads for the P7, P30 and P60 libraries respectively. 10.338, 948 and 10.920  cells were detected, with a mean number of 33.179, 245.972 and 30.857 reads per cell, detecting a median of 2.290, 5.050 and 2.309 of genes per cell.",

CF-specific Hif-1a conditional knockout (cKO) mice were generated by breeding Pdgfra-merCremer (PdgfraMCM/+) Cre recombinase driver mice with Hif-1a-floxed mice (Hif-1aflox/). In Hif-1afl/-; PdgfraMCM/+ progeny, Hif-1a could be conditionally deleted in adult CFs by tamoxifen (tam) administration. We also introduced a Cre-dependent R26tdTomato reporter allele allowing marking of Pdgfra+ CFs and their progeny. In this experiment, we first performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on tdTomato+ cells from the hearts of healthy cKO or heterozygous (HET) adult, male mice using the 10x Genomics Chromium system.

Two distinct technical approaches were used for most tissues: one approach, microfluidic droplet-based 3’-end counting, enabled the survey of thousands of cells at relatively low coverage, while the other, FACS-based full length transcript analysis, enabled characterization of cell types with high sensitivity and coverage. The cumulative data provide the foundation for an atlas of transcriptomic cell biology.

Although distinct WP FSCs exhibit various molecular traits, the origin and the hierarchical differentiation of different cell subsets are not characterized. Here we showed, the organization of splenic WP and the differentiation of WP FSCs were governed by lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTβR) signaling pathway. Cell fate mapping analysis revealed that different WP fibroblastic stromal cells descend from a common perivascular LTβR-sensitive mesenchymal lymphoid organizer cells (mLTo) at prenatal stage. Moreover, embryonic mLTo cells required LTβR signaling to give rise to different WP stromal cell subsets, while the proliferation of these cells was devoid of LTβR signaling but followed the development of WP during ontogeny. Moreover, cell fate mapping from different time point indicated a consecutive commitment of mLTo cells initiated from the proximal region around the splenic artery. RNAseq and differentiation trajectory analysis of distinct FSCs showed that Ltbr-deficient cells and perivascular reticular cells (PRCs) from adult spleen exhibited a progenitor phenotype and revealed a closer hierarchical lineage with embryonic mLTo cells. Taken together, our results unveil that embryonic mLTo cells residing in the perivascular niches can give rise to different FSC populations in a LTβR-dependent manner during development.",

      "longDescription": "Cellular heterogeneity within the mammalian brain poses a challenge towards understanding its complex functions.  Within the olfactory bulb (OB), odor information is processed by subtypes of inhibitory interneurons whose heterogeneity and functionality is influenced by ongoing adult neurogenesis.  To investigate this cellular heterogeneity, and to better understand the developmental programs of adult-born neurons, we utilized single cell RNA sequencing and computational modeling to reveal diverse and transcriptionally distinct neuronal and non-neuronal cell types. We also analyzed molecular changes during adult-born interneuron maturation, and uncovered developmental programs within their gene expression profiles. Finally, we discovered that distinct neuronal subtypes are differentially affected by sensory experience. Together, these data provide a transcriptome-based foundation for investigating subtype-specific neuronal function in the OB, charting the molecular profiles that arise during the maturation and integration of adult-born neurons, and documenting activity-dependent changes in the cellular composition of the olfactory system. To develop a comprehensive profile of cellular heterogeneity within the OB, here we employed high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) (Zheng et al. 2017) of activity manipulated and wildtype mouse olfactory bulbs. This technique allows an in-depth categorization of single cell molecular signatures, and provides an analysis of potential developmental and activity-dependent changes that occur in adult-born neuron populations. Together, our data inform the heterogeneity of interneurons within the OB, provide a molecular blueprint of stereotyped developmental programs for OB interneurons, and reveal the transcriptional changes that govern activity-dependent circuit integration of adult-born neurons. Furthermore, our results suggest that distinct molecular mechanisms act on different subsets of adult-born neurons, driving diversity and survival of adult-born interneuron subsets in an activity-dependent manner.",
