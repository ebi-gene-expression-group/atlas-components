# Single Cell Expression Atlas Organ Anatomogram

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ebi-gene-expression-group/organ-anatomogram.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ebi-gene-expression-group/organ-anatomogram) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/ebi-gene-expression-group/organ-anatomogram/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/ebi-gene-expression-group/organ-anatomogram?branch=master) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0) [![License: CC BY 4.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-CC%20BY%204.0-lightgrey.svg)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)

This is an organ anatomogram for [Single Cell Expression Atlas](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc) that we use to illustrate the experiments.

[See demo here](https://ebi-gene-expression-group.github.io/organ-anatomogram/).

The ontology IDs are sourced from [Uberon](www.uberon.org), [EFO](www.ebi.ac.uk/efo) and [Plant
Ontology](www.plantontology.org/).

To install:
`npm install --save @ebi-gene-expression-group/organ-anatomogram`

You can use it as a React component:

```js
import Anatomogram from '@ebi-gene-expression-group/organ-anatomogram'

...

<Anatomogram .../>

```

Alternatively, if you don’t use React we’re providing a convenience `render` method:

```js
import {render} from '@ebi-gene-expression-group/organ-anatomogram'

...

render(options, target)
```

Where `options` are the props passed as an object, and `target` is an ID of the DOM element that will contain the
anatomogram.

For example code, have a look at [the demo component](https://github.com/gxa/anatomogram/blob/master/html/AnatomogramDemo.js) 
and how we use it in [our Expression Atlas Heatmap](https://github.com/gxa/atlas-heatmap). 
If you want to see it in action, go to [an organism part experiment in Atlas](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/experiments/E-MTAB-513) 
or [a search that returns organism part experiments](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/search?geneQuery=[{%22value%22:%22zinc%20finger%22}]).

## Props

| Name             | Type     | Default value  | Description                                                          |

| selectColour     | string   | purple         |                                                                      |

| highlightOpacity | number   | 0.4            |                                                                      |
| selectOpacity    | number   | 0.4            |                                                                      |
| onMouseOver      | function |   `() => {}`   | Required, but with default value. Callback invoked when the mouse is hovered on a tissue     |
| onMouseOut       | function |   `() => {}`   | Required, but with default value. Callback invoked when the mouse is hovered off a tissue    |
| onClick          | function |   `() => {}`   | Required, but with default value. Callback invoked when a tissue is clicked                  |
| onInjected       | function |   `() => {}`   | Callback invoked when SVG is injected                                |

For a list of available species and IDs have a look at
[`src/json/svgsMetadata.json`](https://github.com/gxa/anatomogram/blob/master/src/json/svgsMetadata.json). The file is automatically generated every time the package is published.

All three callbacks take a single string argument, the ID of the tissue affected by the mouse event.

The state of a tissue is either not shown, shown, highlighted or selected. On `mouseover` the opacity is increased by
0.2. You can read a more technically inclined description of the anatomogram behaviour in [the repository
wiki](https://github.com/gxa/anatomogram/wiki).

## Building

To use the anatomogram in a browser you need to build and bundle the package:

```sh
npm run dist -- --output-public-path='<URL>'
```

`<URL>` is the URL (absolute or relative) from which you’ll be serving the anatomogram (e.g. `/anatomogram/dist/` for
the `gh-pages` branch we use to build the demo page). **Remember to append a final slash!** This is required so that
the code knows where to look for static assets (i.e. SVGs and PNGs). You can read more about this option in [Webpack’s
documentation site](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/output/#output-publicpath).

After building, deployment of `anatomogramDemo.bundle.js` is optional, only if you want to host the demo component.

Include the following in your HTML:

```html
<script src="<URL>/vendors.bundle.js"></script>
<script src="<URL>/anatomogram.bundle.js"></script>

<script>
anatomogram.render(options, target)
</script>
```

### Building for a particular species

You can take out all the unnecessary SVGs and PNGs and change
[`Anatomogram.defaultProps.species`](https://github.com/gxa/anatomogram/blob/master/src/Anatomogram.js#L56) to any of
the supported species. You can see an example in [the `mouse` branch](https://github.com/gxa/anatomogram/tree/mouse).

## Contribute

Read carefully [our authoring guidelines](https://github.com/ebi-gene-expression-group/organ-anatomogram/blob/master/src/svg/ORGAN-README.md) before
adding new tissues or updating IDs in an existing anatomogram or adding a new SVG.

Run `npm run parseSvgs` to parse the updated IDs. When you are finished run a local copy of the demo page:

```sh
rm -rf node-modules
npm install
npx webpack-dev-server -d
```

Go to `localhost:9000` and see that the tissues show up like you want them to.
